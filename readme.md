# jColour

**jColour** is a JavaScript colour manipulation library written in [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org). jColour is inspired heavily by the [SASS](http://sass-lang.com)/[Compass](http://compass-style.org) colour manipulation functions.

jColour is also the first ever colour library to spell the word "colour" correctly.

jColour is written by [Aaron Russell](http://aaronrussell.co.uk), and is released under the [MIT license](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php).
